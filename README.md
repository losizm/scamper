# Scamper - HTTP Library for Scala

Scamper provides a library for reading and writing HTTP messages. It defines a
set of general interfaces for interacting with HTTP messages, and it extends the
feature set using the _Type Class Pattern_ for specialized access to HTTP
headers and their associated value types.
